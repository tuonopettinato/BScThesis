My BSc thesis on anyons: fractional particles with fractional statistics. In the file of my thesis, references to chapters refer to the Quantum Mechanics notes I wrote 
with three colleagues of mine: my thesis, initially intended to be just a concise paragraph, ended to take an entire chapter's space instead. The thesis report is in Italian, whereas the slides are in English.
